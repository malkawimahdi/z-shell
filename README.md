Personal z-shell (ZSH) configuration.


## Dependencies

- zsh-syntax-highlighting - This package provides syntax highlighting for the shell zsh. It enables highlighting of commands whilst they are typed at a zsh prompt into an interactive terminal. This helps in reviewing commands before running them, particularly in catching syntax errors.
- zsh-autosuggestions - Command suggestions based on history and completions.
- web-search - This plugin adds aliases for searching with Google, Wiki, Bing, YouTube and other popular services.
You can use the `web-search` plugin in these two forms:
  * `web_search <context> <term> [more terms if you want]`
  * `<context> <term> [more terms if you want]`

- copyfile - Puts the contents of a file in your system clipboard so you can paste it anywhere.
 Then you can run the command `copyfile <filename>` to copy the file named `filename`.
